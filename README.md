# Elements Trading Card Game
An online fictional trading card game for a group assignment of Fontys University of Applied Sciences. It's a mixture of Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh and Pok√©mon all-in-one with our own features and bright ideas. It's only meant for educational and non-commercial purposes.

## Client and Server
The client of the game is mapped in the "client" folder of this repository. Server is obviously mapped in the "server" folder.
